# The dnsmasq drop-in config file at /etc/dnsmasq.d/40-generated-template-config
# is automatically generated from config drop-in template files in
# /etc/dnsmasq-templates.d.

# Templates are used to generate a config file by replacing template variables
# with their corresponding values. Template variables are specified with curly braces, e.g. a
# variable named "machine-name" would be specified as "{machine-name}". This string-interpolation
# format will be familiar to you if you have used Python 3.6+'s f-strings:
# https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep498 .

# Allowed template variables:
# - machine-name: an automatically-generated machine name, loaded from /run/machine-name.
#     Example: if machine-name has value "metal-slope-23501", the string
#       "machine-{machine-name}" will be rendered as "machine-metal-slope-23501".
# - hostname: the system's hostname, loaded from /etc/hostname.
#     Example: if hostname has value "pkscope-metal-slope-23501", the string
#       "{machine-name}.local" will be rendered as "pkscope-metal-slope-23501.local".
# - custom-domain: a custom domain, loaded from /etc/custom-domain.
#     Example: if custom-domain has value "pkscope", the string "home.{custom-domain}" will
#       be rendered as "home.pkscope".

# If a template variable has an empty value (e.g. because the file which sets the value of that
# variable is missing or if that file doesn't provide a value), any line including that template
# variable will be disabled (by being commented out) in the output.

# To apply your changes immediately without rebooting, restart the
# assemble-dnsmasq-config-templated.service systemd service, and then restart the dnsmasq.service
# systemd service. If you made any changes in /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/dnsmasq-templates.d,
# you will have to reboot.
