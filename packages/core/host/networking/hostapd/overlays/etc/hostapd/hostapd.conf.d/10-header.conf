# The hostapd config at /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf is automatically generated by concatenating all
# hostapd drop-in config fragment files from /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.d, with files concatenated in
# lexicographical order.

# To add a new value, you can deploy a Forklift package which exports a hostapd config fragment file
# to a target in overlays/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.d, or you can manually create a new hostapd
# config fragment file in /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.d (the file will actually be saved in
# /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.d, but it will appear as if it's in
# /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.d).
# To override an existing value, you should disable the Forklift package (or the feature of the
# Forklift package) which sets the value via a drop-in file; if that's not possible, you can
# directly edit the hostapd config fragment file in /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.d which sets the value
# - your changes will override any identically-named file provided by Forklift until you delete the
# corresponding file with your changes from /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.d
# and reboot.

# To apply your changes immediately without rebooting, restart the assemble-hostapd-config.service
# systemd service. If you made any changes in
# /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.d, you will have to reboot.
