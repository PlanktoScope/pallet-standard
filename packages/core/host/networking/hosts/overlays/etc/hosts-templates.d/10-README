# The hosts drop-in fragment at /etc/hosts.d/50-generated-templated is automatically generated from
# hosts drop-in template files in /etc/hosts-templates.d.
# Each hosts template file can consist of multiple lines, with one IP address per line.

# Templates are used to generate lists of hostname mappings by replacing template variables
# with their corresponding values. Template variables are specified with curly braces, e.g. a
# variable named "machine-name" would be specified as "{machine-name}". This string-interpolation
# format will be familiar to you if you have used Python 3.6+'s f-strings:
# https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep498 .

# Allowed template variables:
# - machine-name: an automatically-generated machine name, loaded from /run/machine-name.
#     Example: if machine-name has value "metal-slope-23501", the string
#       "machine-{machine-name}" will be rendered as "machine-metal-slope-23501".
# - hostname: the system's hostname, loaded from /etc/hostname.
#     Example: if hostname has value "pkscope-metal-slope-23501", the string
#       "{machine-name}.local" will be rendered as "pkscope-metal-slope-23501.local".
# - custom-domain: a custom domain, loaded from /etc/custom-domain.
#     Example: if custom-domain has value "pkscope", the string "home.{custom-domain}" will
#       be rendered as "home.pkscope".

# If a template variable has an empty value (e.g. because the file which sets the value of that
# variable is missing or if that file doesn't provide a value), any line including that template
# variable will be disabled (by being commented out) in the output.

# To apply your changes immediately without rebooting, restart the
# assemble-hosts-templated.service systemd service, then restart the assemble-hosts.service systemd
# service. If you made any changes in /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/hosts-templates.d,
# you will have to reboot.
