License-restricted PlanktoScope packages

This directory contains packages which are only available under licenses not
[approved by the OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/); some licenses may include restrictions on
how the software may be used, for example restrictions on governmental uses, commercial uses, or
unethical uses of the software. None of these packages are necessary for operating PlanktoScopes.
These packages are supported by contributions from users, and could end if users stop supporting
them. They may also be removed in a future release due to lack of support by upstream maintainers.
