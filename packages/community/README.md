Community-maintained open-source PlanktoScope packages

This directory contains packages which not included by default in the PlanktoScope OS, but are
available for easy integration. These packages are maintained by users from the community working
with the PlanktoScope core team and which are available under
[OSI-approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/) open-source licenses. These packages are supported
by contributions from users, and they could be removed if their maintainers stop supporting them.
They may also be removed in a future release due to lack of support by upstream maintainers.
