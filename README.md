# pallet-standard
The standard configuration of Forklift package deployments for PlanktoScopes

## Introduction

pallet-standard is a [Forklift](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift) pallet specifying the
standard configuration of Forklift package deployments for the PlanktoScope software distribution.

## Usage

### Deployment

This Github repository has three release channels, each corresponding to a Git branch: `stable`,
`beta`, and `edge`, as well as Git tags for each released version. You should probably use either
the `stable` branch (recommended so that you will automatically be notified for new stable versions)
or a specific Git tag.

You can clone and apply this Forklift pallet to your PlanktoScope using the
[`forklift`](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift) tool. For example, you can run any
of the following `forklift` CLI commands, depending on which release of this pallet you want:
```
// to clone the latest development (unstable) version of the edge branch:
forklift plt switch github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard@edge
// to clone the latest beta or stable (pre-)release of the edge branch:
forklift plt switch github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard@beta
// to clone the latest stable release of the edge branch:
forklift plt switch github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard@stable
// to clone the v2023.9.0 release:
forklift plt switch github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard@v2023.9.0
```

Warning: this will replace all Docker containers on your Docker host with the package deployments
specified by this pallet and delete any Docker containers not specified by this pallet's package
deployments.

### Layering

TBD

### Development

You should clone this Github repository to your local file system. For example, you can clone the
latest unstable version (on the `edge` branch) of the
[`github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard`](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard) pallet
using the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard
```

Then you will need to download/install `forklift` in order to run its commands for development. For
more details and usage information, refer to the
[readme for Forklift](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift#readme), especially the
["Work on a development pallet"](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift#work-on-a-development-pallet)
section.
